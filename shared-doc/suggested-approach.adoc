= Suggested Approach to the Quickstarts

We suggest you approach the quickstarts as follows:

* Regardless of your level of expertise, we suggest you start with the link:helloworld/README{outfilesuffix}[`helloworld`] quickstart. It is the simplest example and is an easy way to prove the server is configured and running correctly.
* If you are a beginner or new to JBoss, start with the quickstarts labeled `Beginner`, then try those marked as `Intermediate`. When you are comfortable with those, move on to the `Advanced` quickstarts.
* Some quickstarts are based upon other quickstarts but have expanded capabilities and functionality. If a prerequisite quickstart is listed, make sure you deploy and test it before looking at the expanded version.
